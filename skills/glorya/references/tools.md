# Glorya tools

The complete Glorya MCP contract: how to connect, every tool with its inputs and results, job statuses, errors and limits. Any MCP client can run Glorya end to end from this page.

## Connection

- Endpoint: `https://platform.glorya.ai/mcp`, streamable HTTP.
- Sign-in: OAuth 2.1 with the user's Glorya account. Discovery starts at `https://platform.glorya.ai/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`, which names the authorization server `https://platform.glorya.ai/api/auth`. It supports dynamic client registration, client ID metadata documents and PKCE. Send the access token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- On sign-in the user picks a default brand. To switch for the conversation, resolve a unique brand with `list_workspaces` and pass its `workspace` on every later brand-specific call. Disambiguate duplicate names. Existing jobs stay bound to their `job_id`.
- Every tool except `get_credits` needs an active Glorya plan on the brand's organization. Work that makes something uses Glorya credits, the same as in the platform. A campaign's ad spend is billed by the ad platform to the user's ad account.

## Read tools

### `list_workspaces`

Finds the account's brands by name, default brand first. Use it to resolve or change the conversation’s selected brand.

Annotations: read-only.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string, 1 to 100 characters | optional | none | Part of the brand name the user said. Case and accents don't matter. |
| `limit` | integer, 1 to 50 | optional | `20` | How many brands to return. |

Returns `workspaces` (each with `id`, `name`, `role` `member` or `viewer`, `ready`, `detail`, `is_default`, `organization_id`, `workspace_name`) and a `note` that says when more brands match.

### `get_brand`

The brand as Glorya knows it: name, description, website, language, colors, fonts, logo, and its products. Create tools don't need it; call it when the user asks about their brand or products.

Annotations: read-only.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | A brand `id` from `list_workspaces`. Omitted uses the connection default; after switching, keep passing the selected brand ID. |

Returns `workspace_id`, `brand` (`name`, `description`, `website_url`, `language`, `colors`, `fonts`, `logo_url`) and `products` (each with `id`, `name`, `description`, `key_features`, `price_range`, `primary_cta`, `image_urls`).

### `get_credits`

The brand's plan and credit balance. It works without a plan, so it can tell the user there is none. Call it when the user asks about credits or their plan.

Annotations: read-only.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | A brand `id` from `list_workspaces`. Omitted uses the connection default; after switching, keep passing the selected brand ID. |

Returns `workspace_id`, `plan` (`name` or null, `status` `none`, `active`, `trialing` or `canceled`, `renews_at`, `trial_ends_at`, `cancel_at_period_end`), `credits` (`total`, `subscription`, `topup`, `free`), `billing_url` and `checkout_url` (set only when there is no active plan: the $99/month Starter checkout).

### `get_integrations`

Which ad platforms are connected and which ad account each one uses. `create_campaign` doesn't need it; call it when the user asks what's connected.

Annotations: read-only.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | A brand `id` from `list_workspaces`. Omitted uses the connection default; after switching, keep passing the selected brand ID. |

Returns `workspace_id` and `ad_platforms` (each with `platform` `meta`, `google_ads` or `tiktok`, `connected`, `account` (`id`, `name`, `currency`) or null, and `connect_url`, the page in Glorya to connect it).

### `list_video_formats`

Every supported video style, including Launch Video. Preview fields are empty strings when no catalog clip exists; selecting the style still locks the format. Call it when the user asks which styles exist, or to find the `id` of a style the user named.

Annotations: read-only.

No inputs.

Returns `formats` (each with `id`, `name`, `preview_video_url`, `poster_url`).

### `get_job`

A job's current state: status, progress, finished images and videos, open questions with their exact choices, page links, the campaign, and a link to open it in Glorya. With `wait_seconds`, it waits for the job to change before it answers.

### `list_jobs`

Recover the selected brand's MCP jobs, newest activity first. Call `get_job` for current status. Existing jobs keep their original brand.

Annotations: read-only.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | Selected brand id. |
| `limit` | integer, 1 to 20 | optional | `10` | Page size. |

An unconfirmed start is not permission to start a replacement. Reuse its original key and inputs.

## Create tools

Each starts a job, uses credits and returns `job_id`, `kind`, `status` (`running`), `workspace_id`, `open_url` and `next_step`. Follow the job with `get_job`. Start the job right away from the user's words; Glorya picks the format, size, language and style, and for a campaign the goal and destination, unless the user named them.

Annotations: writes, not destructive.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |

| `review` | boolean | optional | `false` | Glorya finishes on its own. Set `true` only when the user asks to review or approve steps ("let me review", "show me the concept first"); Glorya then stops for approval at the same steps as in the platform. Never ask the user about it. |

### `create_video_ad`

Starts an on-brand video ad. Rendering takes minutes.

### `create_campaign`

Builds an ad campaign on Meta, Google Ads or TikTok and launches it with real ad spend. By default it runs on its own: Glorya builds the campaign, makes the ads and launches it without asking. With `review: true` it keeps the campaign paused until the user approves the launch. Uses credits; the ad platform bills the ad spend to the user's ad account. Counts against the same job limits.

Annotations: destructive, open world.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `brief` | string, 1 to 4,000 characters | required | none | The user's own words, such as "Get leads for our free trial". |

| `destination` | string | optional | none | One of `landing_page`, `instant_form`, `website`. Only when the user said it. Empty means Glorya recommends one. `landing_page`: Glorya builds and publishes a new landing page for the campaign. `instant_form`: Meta only, and not for the `buyers` goal. `website`: needs `website_url`. |
| `website_url` | string, up to 2,048 characters | optional | none | The page the ads link to when `destination` is `website`. |
| `references` | array of https URLs, up to 8 | optional | `[]` | Only links the user gave; Glorya uses them as the ad creatives. Empty means Glorya makes them. |

| `review` | boolean | optional | `false` | Glorya builds and launches on its own. Set `true` only when the user asks to review or approve ("let me review the campaign first"); Glorya then keeps it paused until the user approves the launch. Never ask the user about it. |

In `get_job`, `campaign` appears once Glorya starts preparing: `platform`, `stage` (`planning`, `preparing`, `ready`, `incomplete` or `cancelled`), `daily_budget`, `currency`, `ad_account_id`, `campaign_id` (when known) and `manage_url`. For the live status, spend and results after launch, call `list_campaigns`.

## Act tools

### `respond`

Sends the user's answer to a question Glorya asked (`get_job` status `needs_input`).

Annotations: writes, not destructive.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string, 1 to 200 characters | required | none | The job with the open question. |
| `answer` | string, 1 to 4,000 characters | required | none | For `decision` and `approve` questions, one exact label from `choices`. For `input`, `revise` and `clarify`, the user's own words. |
| `request_id` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | The question's `request_id`. Needed when more than one question is open. |

Returns `job_id`, `request_id`, `answer`, `status` (`submitted`) and `next_step`.

### `refine`

Asks Glorya to change a job's result: new copy, another variation, a different color, a page edit, a campaign change. Uses credits; page edits need at least 100.

Annotations: writes, not destructive.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string, 1 to 200 characters | required | none | The job to change. |
| `instruction` | string, 1 to 4,000 characters | required | none | What to change, in the user's words. |
| `review` | boolean | optional | `false` | Image ads, video ads and campaigns only. Leave it out to keep the job's own choice: a job created with `review: true` stays in review. Set `true` only when the user asks to review or approve steps. Never ask the user about it. |

Returns the same fields as a create tool. Follow the same `job_id` with `get_job`.

### `publish_site`

Puts a finished landing page or website live on the internet. Call it only when the user explicitly asks to publish.

Annotations: destructive, open world.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string, 1 to 200 characters | required | none | A completed landing page or website job. |
| `slug` | string, up to 63 characters | optional | none | Subdomain: lowercase letters, digits and dashes, not starting or ending with a dash. Empty keeps the current or default one. |

Returns `job_id`, `status` (`publishing`), `open_url` and `next_step`. Then call `get_job` until `site.live_url` is set.

### `cancel_job`

Stops a running image ad, video ad or campaign job and closes its open question. Finished files stay in Glorya. A campaign that's already live keeps running; pause it with `set_campaign_status` when the user asks. Landing page and website builds can't be cancelled.

Annotations: destructive.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_id` | string, 1 to 200 characters | required | none | The job to stop. |

Returns `job_id`, `status` (`cancelling`, or `nothing_running`) and `next_step`.

## Job status

| Status | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `running` | Call `get_job` again with `wait_seconds` 30. Tell the user now and then that it is still working. |
| `needs_input` | Show each item in `questions` as written, with its exact `choices` and `preview_images`. Send the user's answer with `respond`, then keep following the job. |
| `completed` | Share the results: each asset `url`, `site.preview_url` and `site.live_url` for pages, or `campaign.manage_url` for campaigns (then `list_campaigns` for its live status), plus `open_url`. If `progress` asks the user something, relay it and send the answer with `refine`. |
| `failed` | Tell the user what `error` or `progress` says. Offer `refine` with a changed instruction, or a new job. |
| `cancelled` | The job stopped. Finished files stay in Glorya, and a live campaign keeps running. |

Question kinds: `decision` and `approve` take one exact label from `choices`; `input`, `revise` and `clarify` also take the user's own words.

## Errors

A failed call returns `isError: true` with a message for the user and a JSON object with `error` (the code) and details such as links. Relay the message and its link. Don't retry in a loop.

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan_required` | The brand's organization has no active plan. | Share `checkout_url` ($99/month Starter). Try again after the user starts it. |
| `no_credits` | Not enough credits. | Share `billing_url` so the user can top up. |
| `setting_up` | The brand is still setting up. | Try again in a few minutes. Share `open_url`. |
| `available_shortly` | This feature isn't ready for this brand from AI apps yet (its agent is being updated). | Suggest Glorya in the browser (`open_url`). Landing pages and websites work. |
| `agent_unavailable` | The brand's agent is unavailable or updating. | Try again in a minute, or open Glorya. |
| `integration_required` | The ad platform isn't connected or has no ad account selected. | Share `connect_url`; `platform` and `connected_platforms` say what is connected. Then try again. |
| `workspace_required` | No default brand and several brands. | Ask which brand, or find it with `list_workspaces` and `query`. Pass its `id` as `workspace`. |
| `workspace_not_found` | The `workspace` id isn't one of the user's brands. | Call `list_workspaces` with `query` set to the brand the user named. |
| `view_only` | The account can only view this brand. | Tell the user; they can't create for it. |
| `limit_reached` | Too many jobs running or started. | Wait for a job to finish, or stop an image ad, video ad or campaign job with `cancel_job`. |
| `rate_limited` | `get_job` was called too often. | Wait `retry_after_seconds`, then poll with `wait_seconds` 30. |
| `invalid_reference` | A reference link can't be used. | Ask for a public https link within the limits below. |
| `invalid_budget` | `daily_budget` is outside the platform's range. | Ask for a budget between `min` and `max` (in `currency`). |
| `invalid_destination` | The destination doesn't fit: `instant_form` is Meta only and not for buyers, `website` needs `website_url`. | Change the destination or pass `website_url`. |
| `job_not_found` | No job with that id for this account. | Check the `job_id`. |
| `no_open_question` | The question was answered, expired, or `request_id` is needed. | Call `get_job` for the current questions. |
| `job_changed` | The job changed while the request was on its way. | Call `get_job` for the current state, then try again. |
| `not_publishable` | Not a site, still building, waiting for an answer, or already publishing. | Wait for `completed`, then publish. |
| `not_cancellable` | Landing page and website builds can't be cancelled. | Use `refine` to change the result instead. |
| `upstream_error` | Glorya couldn't do the action. | Tell the user the message. |
| `internal_error` | An unexpected error. | Try again in a moment. |

## Limits

- Jobs running at once: 3 per brand, 10 per organization. Campaigns and changes with `refine` count.
- New jobs: 30 per hour per person.
- `get_job`: 120 calls a minute per person. Use `wait_seconds` instead of a tight loop.
- `brief`, `instruction` and `answer`: up to 4,000 characters.
- `references`: public https links only, checked by their bytes. Up to 6 JPG, PNG or WebP images (20 MB and 4,096 px a side each) and 2 MP4 or MOV videos (200 MB and 2 minutes each), 250 MB per call, all downloaded within 40 seconds.
- `list_assets`, `list_sites` and `list_campaigns`: up to 20 per call. `get_job`: up to 8 assets per job.
- `daily_budget`: 10 to 500 on Meta and Google Ads, 50 to 500 on TikTok, in the ad account's currency.
- Landing pages and websites need at least 100 credits to start, continue or change.

## Prompts

The server also offers four prompts without arguments: `image-ad`, `video-ad`, `landing-page` and `website` (in Claude Code, `/glorya:image-ad` and so on). Each starts that job right away.

## Recovery after a lost response

Create calls reserve admission durably before dispatch. Reusing an `idempotency_key` with the same tool, brand and inputs returns the same job. `idempotency_conflict` means the key was reused for different work. `creation_pending` or `creation_uncertain` means a start may already have been accepted: never start a replacement with a new key. Keep `request_id` and any `job_id`, check that job, or recover it with `list_jobs`. Uncertain requests are not automatically dispatched a second time. Limits serialize admission per user and organization.

`creation_rejected` means the original start failed before job dispatch (for example, an invalid reference). It releases its concurrent slot. Correct the inputs and use a new key. A recorded campaign activation failure remains a failed job even when the preparation draft is ready; check existing campaigns before attempting replacement work.

## Existing sites and campaigns

### `get_site`

Read any accessible site from `list_sites`, including platform-created sites. Read `clarification` and relay it to the user; answer with `edit_site`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | Selected brand id. |

Returns site_id, workspace_id, kind, name, status, publish_status, preview_url, live_url, error, updated_at, open_url, and clarification (question and choices) or null. A live URL from an earlier publication is not proof a new publication succeeded; check publish_status.

### `edit_site`

Annotations: read-only.

| Input | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | string, 1 to 200 characters | optional | none | Selected brand id. |

Returns workspace_id, campaign_id, platform, name, status, currency, open_url, range (from, to, timezone), reporting_complete, totals (spend, clicks, impressions, ctr_percent, cpc) or null, daily (date, spend, impressions, clicks, conversions or null, synced_at), actions (date, action, value), and note. Currency amounts are major units. Partial totals cover only returned rows.

### `set_campaign_status`

Pause or resume an existing campaign in the selected brand and ad account. Resuming spends the campaign's current budget. Only use the status the user requested. This is separate from cancelling the MCP job that created it.

Annotations: destructive, write.
